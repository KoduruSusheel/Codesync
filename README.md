# Codesync
A simple Python tool to auto-backup lab code. Monitors your folder, and on exit (Ctrl+C) sends all .py files to your Gmail as attachments using App Passwords. Saves time, prevents data loss, and ensures you always have the latest code safely stored.
CodeSync ‚Äì Automatic Python Lab Backup Tool


üìå Problem

In our lab sessions, we often get only limited time (e.g., 3 hours) to write and complete assignments.
Since the lab systems reset or we need to continue coding later in the hostel, many students email themselves partial code.

The problem:

Sending code manually takes extra time.
Sometimes students forget to back up their progress.
We needed a simple tool to automatically back up code safely without distractions.

üí° Solution

CodeSync is a Python script that automatically monitors your working folder.

.While you are coding in the lab, it silently watches all .py files.
.When you finish and stop the script (Ctrl + C), it collects all .py files in that folder and emails them to you as attachments.
.This ensures you always have the latest versions backed up in your email.

One-time Setup:
.Generate a Google App Password (since Gmail requires this for security).
.Go to Google Account Security
.Enable 2-Step Verification.
.Create an App Password for "Mail" ‚Üí "Device: Other (CodeSync)".
.Copy the 16-character password.
.Save this script as codesync.py in your coding folder.

Update these lines with your details:

sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
app_password = "your_16_digit_app_password"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
.Open your lab folder (where you want to code).
.Place codesync.py inside that folder.
.Run it in terminal:
    python codesync.py
.Start coding as usual.
.When you‚Äôre done, stop with Ctrl + C.
.An email will be sent with all your .py files attached.
